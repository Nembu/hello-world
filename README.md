# hello-world
I tremble with fear.
I don't know what I'll do here. Perhaps I'll code feverishly for many months, many years, before dropping off the web like an ill-caught fly. O' the wonders I shall see, O' the glory I shall be. Clinking chessboards with drunken Belgians will replace the clicking of keys I'm accustomed to. Yet it is too early for that. Much too early.

But a time will come.
